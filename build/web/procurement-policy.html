                            <br>
                            <h6><u>Introduction</u></h6>
                            <p>
                                At Secure Sensor Innovative Design Ltd we take social and environmental factors into consideration alongside 
                                financial factors in making decisions on the purchase of goods and the commissioning of services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our purchasing decisions should where practicably consider whole life cost and the associated risks and implications for society and the environment. 
                                Procurement can make a significant contribution to our goals of sustainable economic development and resource minimisation by ensuring that the goods and services 
                                we buy consider optimum environmental performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our process also has a role to play in minimising any risk of social exploitation within the supply chain. 
                                We believe that this not only makes business sense, it also has the potential to improve the living and working standards of people around the world
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This policy clarifies the expectation that our staff and suppliers must have a natural respect for our ethical standards in the context of their own particular culture and that 
                                relationships with our suppliers are based on the principle of fair and honest dealings at all times. 
                                The same principle of fair and honest dealings must be extended to all others with whom our suppliers do business, including employees, 
                                sub-contractors and other third parties and their local communities.
                            </p>

                            <h6><u>Our Policy</u></h6>
                            <p>
                                Secure Sensor Innovative Design Ltdâ€™s ethical supply chain policy requires that the ethical issues and social responsibility within supply chains are understood and addressed when managing business to business supplier relationships and through the purchasing of goods and services from our suppliers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Upholding the principles of this policy is a shared responsibility between Secure Sensor Innovative Design Ltd and our suppliers and the policy will be adopted at senior and director level within the company.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We expect our suppliers to assign and accept similar responsibility.
                            </p>

                            <h6><u>Objectives</u></h6>
                            <p>Sustainable Procurement</p>

                            <p>
                                We seek to avoid adverse social and environmental impact in the supply-chain, the reduction of environmental impact from service operations and the purchase of products that meet recognised environmental standards.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Employment law including: minimum working age, discrimination in respect of race, gender, religion, disability, harassment and bullying etc.
